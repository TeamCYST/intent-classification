# Intent Classification

Intent Classification is one of the very first steps to take to when creating a very smart AI or chatbot. This is an open source project to gather data (i.e. statements, sentences or speech) and classify the data into it's respective intent class.

## Why "Intent Classification"

When your brain receives a message, the first thing you subconsciously do is to get the intent of the message. Whether it's a greeting, a compliment or an insult, you can only determine that if you know the intent of the message and also spending sometime with fellow humans which is based on experience.

We would love to use AI to mimic this very simple yet complex process. In order to do this we would require data.

This data gathered will remain open source for further research enquiries in the area of Natural Language Processing (NLP), Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence (AI).

### Project Structure

The datasets can be found in the datasets folder. Each dataset is named after the intent of the statements/text it contains. The structure is as follows:

```
[
 {
   "statement": "can i get the menu",
   "intent": "menu"
 }
]
```
